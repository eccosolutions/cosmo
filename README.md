This repository is a clone of the trunk by:

    git svn clone http://svn.osafoundation.org/server/cosmo/trunk -r 7290

The tags and branches have not been imported, hence the visibility of releases being done on branches is lost.

However, the point at which this file is getting created represents the 1.2.0 release tag, and is tagged in git as such.
